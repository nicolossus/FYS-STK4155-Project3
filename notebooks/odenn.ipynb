    "## Differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a neural network can approximate any function at a single hidden layer along with one input and output layer to any given precision.\n",
    "Having this in mind, we will look closer at whether a neural network manages to solve for a function in an equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A differential equation is an equation where the solution is a function. In the equation, it is given some relations between the function's derivatives subject to some given conditions.\n",
    "Typically, a differential equation is solved numerically using approximations of Taylor series.\n",
    "These kind of methods usually depends of choosing step sizes along each dimension that are small enough for the approximations to yield accurate results.\n",
    "As we will see in the examples, using a neural network manages to outperform some well known methods in selected cases.\n",
    "A possible way to solve the equation that we will look into, is to formulate a trial solution involving the result from a neural network.\n",
    "The trial solution should hopefully converge into the true solution.\n",
    "Be aware though, not all differential equations has an analytical solution.\n",
    "We will stick with those that has an analytical solution such that we can check how well the network performs.\n",
    "To make the trial solution converge to the true solution, setting up the cost function and updating the weights and biases within the neural network is crucial for the trial solution to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the equation to solve for\n",
    "A differential equation is a equation where the solution is a function.\n",
    "The equation describes how the derivatives of the function behaves in a given domain along with some conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a differential equation, it is desirable to know how to reformulate it into an equation a neural network can solve.\n",
    "Having decided on which activation functions each layer should use, along with the number of hidden layers and neurons within each layer,\n",
    "the changeable parameters of a neural network are the weights and biases for each neuron in every layer in the net.\n",
    "If a differential equation is reformulated into an equation where minimization of some parameters must be done,\n",
    "a neural net could possibly solve this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trial solution might be tricky to find in general.\n",
    "Due to the Universal Approximation Theorem, one could hope that outcome of the deep neural net might solve a given differential equation, even though it is used in a simple trial solution.\n",
    "Let us try this idea on some well-known ordinary differential equations and thereafter try to solve for functions defined by two variables, giving partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
