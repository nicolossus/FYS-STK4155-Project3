Jupyter notebooks used for the project analyses. If notebook won't display on Github, copy and paste the notebook URL from Github to [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

- [eigenvalue_tf.ipyn](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS-STK4155-Project3/blob/master/notebooks/eigenvalue_tf.ipynb): Analyses of the eigenvalue problem Euler's method, Numpy's linalg.eig and the feed-forward neural network model employed within the TensorFlow framework. [View in nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/nicolossus/FYS-STK4155-Project3/blob/master/notebooks/eigenvalue_tf.ipynb).

- [heat_pde_eigval_ffnn_autograd.ipynb](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS-STK4155-Project3/blob/master/notebooks/heat_pde_eigval_ffnn_autograd.ipynb): Analyses of the heat equation and eigenvalue problem with a homemade feed-forward neural network model. The results from these analyses are not present in the report, as we found them suboptimal compared to those from the FFNN model employed within the TensorFlow framework.

- [heat_pde_with_fe_and_tf.ipynb](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS-STK4155-Project3/blob/master/notebooks/heat_pde_with_fe_and_tf.ipynb): Analyses of the heat equation problem with both the Forward Euler explicit scheme and the feed-forward neural network model employed within the TensorFlow framework as methods to solve it.

- [lecture_odenn.ipynb](https://github.com/nicolossus/FYS-STK4155-Project3/blob/master/notebooks/lecture_odenn.ipynb): Lecture notebook by Kristine B. Hein about using neural networks to solve ODEs and PDEs. Used extensively in this project as reference material.
