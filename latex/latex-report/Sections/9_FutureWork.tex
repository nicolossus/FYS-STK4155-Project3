We did not study the computation time for the methods used in the eigenvalue problem in any detail, even though the Euler method clearly was faster. Another thing to investigate is the optimal distribution of the time points. Since the slope of the graphs for both the vector components and the Rayleigh quotient are highest near the start point, we could try e.g. time points numbers spaced evenly on a logarithmic scale.

cases were the network performs better than traditional methods
